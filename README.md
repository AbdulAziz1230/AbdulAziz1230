A guy who likes to code in C++(/Python? <sub>don't really code in it anymore</sub>) and never finishes his projects. I mostly have interest in game/app development <sub>([Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) my beloved, Pygame for Python though. Who needs a app library when those two exist! (I don't want to learn, okay...? ): )</sub>

And I love Oneshot and Niko. Yeah, just wanted to include that in here.
