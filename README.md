A guy who likes to code in C++(/Python? <sub>don't really code in it anymore</sub>) and never finishes his projects. I mostly have interest in game development/App development <sub>([Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) my beloved, Pygame for python though.)</sub>

And I love Oneshot and Niko. Yeah, I wanted to include the in here.
